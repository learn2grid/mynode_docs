# Create Lightning Wallet

To create a Lightning wallet on your MyNode, first, click on the "Lightning Wallet" button on the main MyNode page. Next click "Create Wallet" and you will be given a seed phrase.

**This phrase is critical and anyone with this phrase has access to your wallet. Write this phrase down for a backup and do not share it with anyone!**

Click "Continue" after you have written down your seed phrase.

On the next page, re-enter your seed phrase to verify your backup has been created properly. Click "Create" to create your wallet!
