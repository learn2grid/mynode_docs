# Restore Lightning Wallet

If you already have a Lighting Wallet and want to restore it, you can do so via the MyNode interface.

**Note:** You will only see the options to create or restore a wallet if no wallet exists. If a wallet has been created, you will first need to delete the Lightning wallet via the settings page before it can be restored.

## Restoring a Lightning Wallet

First, click on Create Wallet under the Lightning app on the MyNode home page.

Then, click on "Restore Wallet from Seed" on the Lightning page. 

**You will need your seed phrase and Static Channel Backup file!**

On the next page, enter your seed phrase and upload your Static Channel Backup (SCB) file. Click Create.

This will restore you on-chain balance, close all channels that had been opened, and restore those funds in you on chain wallet. Seeing the channel funds appear may take a while.

Your Lightning wallet is now setup and ready to use!

## Manual Recovery

If all funds do not re-appear, you may need to use the lightning CLI to recover or check on the status of channels that are being closed.
