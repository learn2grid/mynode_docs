# Netdata

## Overview

Netdata is distributed, real-time performance and health monitoring for systems and applications. It is a highly-optimized monitoring agent you install on all your systems and containers. It provides unparalleled insights, in real-time, of everything happening on the systems it's running on, using highly interactive web dashboards. A highly-efficient database stores long-term historical metrics for days, weeks, or months, all at 1-second granularity. It is fast and efficient, designed to permanently run on all systems (physical and virtual servers, containers, IoT devices), without disrupting their core function.

To open the Netdata dashboard, scroll to the bottom of your MyNode homepage, and click on the **Settings** button.

Next click on the `Open Netdata` button, as shown here:
