## Step 3 - Upgrade the SD card

The simplest solution is to upgrade the SD card to a larger one. You can follow the instructions at mynodebtc.com/downoad and flash the software onto a new, larger SD card. A 64 GB SD card will be plenty large and only costs around $10 on <a href="https://amzn.to/3NAPvPQ" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.

Steps
- Flash software onto new SD card
- Shut down device
- Remove existing SD card and insert new one
- Power device back on
- Note: Password will be reset to bolt and some apps may need to be re-installed
