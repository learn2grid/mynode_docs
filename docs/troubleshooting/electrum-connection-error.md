## Verify Electrum Server is Running

Verify Electrum status icon on the MyNode home screen is green and the status is Running. On the status page, verify that there are no obvious errors in the Electrum Server log.

## Clear Electrum Wallet Certificates

If your device has changed IP addresses or your Electrum data was cleared, you client may have cached an old certificate and is preventing the connection. On your PC or laptop running the electrum wallet, find the electrum data folder.
